// showdown.js -- A javascript port of Markdown.
//
// Copyright (c) 2007 John Fraser.
//
// Original Markdown Copyright (c) 2004-2005 John Gruber
//   <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>
//
// Redistributable under a BSD-style open source license.
// See license.txt for more information.
//
// The full source distribution is at:
//
//				A A L
//				T C A
//				T K B
//
//   <http://www.attacklab.net/>
//
//
// Wherever possible, Showdown is a straight, line-by-line port
// of the Perl version of Markdown.
//
// This is not a normal parser design; it's basically just a
// series of string substitutions.  It's hard to read and
// maintain this way,  but keeping Showdown close to the original
// design makes it easier to port new features.
//
// More importantly, Showdown behaves like markdown.pl in most
// edge cases.  So web applications can do client-side preview
// in Javascript, and then build identical HTML on the server.
//
// This port needs the new RegExp functionality of ECMA 262,
// 3rd Edition (i.e. Javascript 1.5).  Most modern web browsers
// should do fine.  Even with the new regular expression features,
// We do a lot of work to emulate Perl's regex functionality.
// The tricky changes in this file mostly have the "attacklab:"
// label.  Major or self-explanatory changes don't.
//
// Smart diff tools like Araxis Merge will be able to match up
// this file with markdown.pl in a useful way.  A little tweaking
// helps: in a copy of markdown.pl, replace "#" with "//" and
// replace "$text" with "text".  Be sure to ignore whitespace
// and line endings.
//
//
// Showdown usage:
//
//   var text = "Markdown *rocks*.";
//
//   var converter = new Showdown.converter();
//   var html = converter.makeHtml(text);
//
//   alert(html);
//
// Note: move the sample code to the bottom of this
// file before uncommenting it.

The first one performs a shallow copy of the receiver, while the second one performs a deep copy.\nThe hook method `#postCopy` can be overriden in subclasses to copy fields as necessary to complete the full copy. It will be sent by the copy of the receiver.\n\n##Comparison\n\nI understand equality `#=` and identity `#==` comparison.\n\n##Error handling\n\n- `#halt` is the typical message to use for inserting breakpoints during debugging.\n- `#error:` throws a generic error exception\n- `#doesNotUnderstand:` handles the fact that there was an attempt to send the given message to the receiver but the receiver does not understand this message.\n	Overriding this message can be useful to implement proxies for example.",e.addMethod(e.method({selector:"->",category:"converting",fn:function(s){function r(){return e.Association||("undefined"==typeof Association?t:Association)}var o=this;return e.withContext(function(){var e;return e=n(r())._key_value_(o,s)},function(t){t.fill(o,"->",{anObject:s},e.Object)})},args:["anObject"],source:"-> anObject\n	^ Association key: self value: anObject",messageSends:["key:value:"],referencedClasses:["Association"]}),e.Object),e.addMethod(e.method({selector:"=",category:"comparing",fn:function(t){var n=this;return e.withContext(function(){var e;return e=n.__eq_eq(t)},function(s){s.fill(n,"=",{anObject:t},e.Object)})},args:["anObject"],source:"= anObject\n	^ self == anObject",messageSends:["=="],referencedClasses:[]}),e.Object),e.addMethod(e.method({selector:"==",category:"comparing",fn:function(t){var s=this;return e.withContext(function(e){var r,o;return r=s._identityHash(),e.sendIdx.identityHash=1,o=n(r).__eq(n(t)._identityHash())},function(n){n.fill(s,"==",{anObject:t},e.Object)})},args:["anObject"],source:"== anObject\n	^ self identityHash = anObject identityHash",messageSends:["=","identityHash"],referencedClasses:[]}),e.Object),e.addMethod(e.method({selector:"asJSON",category:"converting",fn:function(){function s(){return e.HashedCollection||("undefined"==typeof HashedCollection?t:HashedCollection)

Events\n\n    The `events` protocol contains all methods related to events (delegating event handling to jQuery).\n\n    Example: `aTag onClick: [ window alert: 'clicked' ]`\n\n3. Attributes\n\n    The `attribute` protocol contains methods for attribute manipulation (delegating to jQuery too).\n\n    Example: `aTag at: 'value' put: 'hello world'`\n\n4. Raw access and jQuery\n\n    The `#element` method can be used to access to JavaScript DOM element object.\n\n    Example: `aTag element cssStyle`\n\n    Use `#asJQuery` to access to the receiver converted into a jQuery object.\n\n    Example: `aTag asJQuery css: 'color' value: 'red'`",e.addMethod(e.method({selector:"accesskey:",category:"attributes",fn:function(t){var n=this;return e.withContext(function(){return n._at_put_("accesskey",t),n},function(s){s.fill(n,"accesskey:",{aString:t},e.TagBrush)})},args:["aString"],source:"accesskey: aString\n	self at: 'accesskey' put: aString",messageSends:["at:put:"],referencedClasses:[]}),e.TagBrush),e.addMethod(e.method({selector:"action:",category:"attributes",fn:function(t){var n=this;return e.withContext(function(){return n._at_put_("action",t),n},function(s){s.fill(n,"action:",{aString:t},e.TagBrush)})},args:["aString"],source:"action: aString\n	self at: 'action' put: aString",messageSends:["at:put:"],referencedClasses:[]}),e.TagBrush),e.addMethod(e.method({selector:"addBrush:",category:"adding",fn:function(t){var s=this;return e.withContext(function(){return s._appendChild_(n(t)._element()),t},function(n){n.fill(s,"addBrush:",{aTagBrush:t},e.TagBrush)})},args:["aTagBrush"],source:"addBrush: aTagBrush\n	self appendChild: aTagBrush element.\n	^ aTagBrush",messageSends:["appendChild:","element"],referencedClasses:[]}),e.TagBrush),e.addMethod(e.method({selector:"align:",category:"attributes",fn:function(t){var n=this;return e.withContext(function(){return n._at_put_("align",t),n},function(s){s.fill(n,"align:",{aString:t},e.TagBrush)})},args:["aString"],source:"align: aString\n	self at: 'align' put: aString",messageSends:["at:put:"],referencedClasses:[]}),e.TagBrush),e.addMethod(e.method({selector:"alt:",category:"attributes",fn:function(t){var n=this;return e.withContext(function(){return n._at_put_("alt",t),n},function(s){s.fill(n,"alt:",{aString:t},e.TagBrush)})},args:["aString"],source:"alt: aString\n	self at: 'alt' put: aString",messageSends:["at:put:"],referencedClasses:[]}),e.TagBrush),e.addMethod(e.method({selector:"append:",category:"adding",fn:function(t){var s=this;return e.withContext(function(){return n(t)._appendToBrush_(s),s},function(n){n.fill(s,"append:",{anObject:t},e.TagBrush)})},args:["anObject"],source:"append: anObject\n	anObject appendToBrush: self",messageSends:["appendToBrush:"],referencedClasses:[]}),e.TagBrush),e.addMethod(e.method({selector:"appendBlock:",category:"adding",fn:function(t){var s,r=this;return e.withContext(function(e){return s=n(r["@canvas"])._root(),n(r["@canvas"])._root_(r),e.sendIdx["root:"]=1,n(t)._value_(r["@canvas"]),n(r["@canvas"])._root_(s),r},function(n){n.fill(r,"appendBlock:",{aBlock:t,root:s},e.TagBrush)})},args:["aBlock"],source:"appendBlock: aBlock\n	| root |\n	root := canvas root.\n	canvas root: self.\n	aBlock value: canvas.\n	canvas root: root",messageSends:["root","root:","value:"],referencedClasses:[]}),e.TagBrush),e.addMethod(e.method({selector:"appendChild:",category:"adding",fn:function(t){var n=this;return e.withContext(function(){var e=n["@element"];return null==e.canHaveChildren||e.canHaveChildren?e.appendChild(t):e.text=String(e.text)+t.innerHTML,n},function(s){s.fill(n,"appendChild:",{anElement:t},e.TagBrush)})},args:["anElement"],source:"appendChild: anElement\n	\"In IE7 and IE8 appendChild fails on several node types.
